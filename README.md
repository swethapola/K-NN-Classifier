# K-NN-Classifier
This project was my final project for Data 8 at UC Berkeley.

I built a K nearest neighbors classifier to predict the genre of a movie based ~5000 word frequencies. 
The classifier is trained on a set of 205 movies on 20 features. This classifier achieved an accuracy of 81% on a test set of 37 movies.
